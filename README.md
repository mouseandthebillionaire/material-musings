# Musings on the Materials 

A place to actively reflect on the things that I am reading/seeing/hearing.

Stray thoughts about this (to be updated throughout the lifespan of this endeavor):

- the main desire here is to actively write about the media that I am taking in. This is both to better process what I actually think and to "prime the pump" for future thought
- I can't imagine that this will be useful for anyone else, but this will be public because I don't want to deal with setting up (and paying for) a private repo - but maybe later if things get too *real*?
- the genesis of this idea comes from the recently completed [PhD Comps process](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/RAGE),specifically the [active reflections on the reading list](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/RAGE/blob/main/relatedWork.md)
- starting out, I think I will order these alphabetically. Chronologically obviously makes the most sense, but
	- things aren't necessarily actually finished in a real chronological fashion - the reading of a book often takes months / the watchings of films while cleaning the kitchen can take days
	- there is overlap where one thing starts and others finish, and a chronological listing doesn't communicate this well
	- GitHub commit logs make a chronological understanding possible, so why not leverage that already existing structure
- at some point it will probably be worthwhile to group these in come way (subject / media type / etc), but for now I will just list them all in a jumble.
