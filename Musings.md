## Koyama, K. _Three Mile an Hour God_

### I Cannot Push Time Around

A very good essay how the way in which we approach time effects our experience of it. There is a certain tree that Koyoma touches daily on his commute, and he claims that many Japanese do the same thing as a daily ritual (although not always with natural objects. "\[i]t could be a roadside postbox, a telephone pole, the edge of a table of a vegetable stall.... I touched this morning the same spot of this great tree and I feel assured" (13)) 

The touching, the pushing - is what's important. We can push papers; we can push other commuters; we can push buttons in elevators. But we cannot push time. It moves without us. "But time humiliates me. It limits me. I cannot push it. Time pushes me. I say innocently that 'time flows". actually it may be I that and flowing." (13) 

But beyond this, the "temperature" of time is tied to tranquility and the idea of Nirvana ("the state of absolute tranquility that comes from one who is completely cooled" (13)).

"Coolness comes to man when he frees himself of attachment ... For the cooled man, time  also is cooled. Cooled time is tranquil. For the hot man time is hot. Hot time is violent. Freedom from greed is freedom from time" (14)

Koyama claims that the Buddha combines greed and time. In this instance time is changed by our handling of unnatural greed, want, desires, unsettling. A voracious 'want' is the enemy of tranquility. Is there a way to create an experience that communicates this? Does the very act of creating something new in the world feed into this 'culture of want?' Can we make experiences/products/writing/etc that work as an enemy of want vs an enemy of tranquility?

## Nguyen, C.  [_Games: Agency as Art_](https://academic.oup.com/book/32137)

Unsurprisingly, I already get a sense that I am going to love this book. Nguyen's interview with [Keywords in Play](https://www.critical-distance.com/2021/03/15/agency-thi-nguyen-keywords-in-play-episode-10/) way back in 2021 was *so good* and it is shocking (not shocking) that I am only just now getting to reading this. 

This quote from Andrew Darley condemning games feels useful "Computer games are machine-like: they solicit intense concentration from the player who is caught up in their mechanisms ... leaving little room for reflection other than an instrumental type of thinking that is more or less commensurate with their own workings" (7) - In general, there feels to be a lot of material in Nguyen's text that can support games doing something *more* by the very nature of the aesthetic quality of agency ("crstallization of paracticality" (13)). The statement that "games can be a way that we *collaborate* in the project of developing our agency and autonomy" (18) is especially useful. Does this help to strengthen the argument that games are able to function in the same way as "architecture" does for [Djebarra et al](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/RAGE/blob/main/relatedWork.md#djebbara-z-et-al-contemplative-neuroaesthetics-and-architecture-a-sensorimotor-exploration-2023)? As a means for the designer and user to set up shared experiential goals?

I also appreciate how Nguyen is widening the discourse to all games (chance, sport, party games, etc) rather than just digital games, and it will be interesting to see the examples that he comes up with throughout.
